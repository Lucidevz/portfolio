            <h1>BOIDS SIMULATION</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>Boids simulation was a solo project about demonstrating steering and flocking behaviours within a set of AI agents. I've expanded on the basic principles of boid movement to create more advanced behaviour, and also included optimisation techniques such as multi-threading and an oct-tree. This project was made in Unreal Engine 5 with C++.</p>

            <p>I used all the standard principles of boid behaviour, developed by Craig Reynolds, to create a 3D artificial life simulation. 'Alignment', 'Cohesion', and 'Separation' are all used to allow a large amount of objects (my project uses space ships) to move together as a flock. I've expanded upon this by adding features such as teams, which makes all boids flock within separate groups, 2 types of containment behaviour, and the option to visualise some of the calculations being performed, such as the boids direction of movement.</p>

            <p>I also looked into ways of increasing performance of the simulation, and added 3 optimisation techniques: Intermittent thinking, multi-threading and an oct-tree. For multi-threading, I had to find out how to use Unreal Engines built in C++ class for creating and handling threads. As actors cannot be modified outside of the main game thread, I came up with an approach to perform all the calculations for individual groups of boids within separate threads. I then applied the found results inside of the main game thread, where it was safe to do so, once all of the other threads had finished. </p>

            <p>I researched into the theory behind different types of spatial-partitioning used within games and simulations, and ended up finding the oct-tree to be the best choice for my needs. I made a custom oct-tree class in C++ that allowed me to split up 3D space depending on how many boids were in a given area. The system is re-usable, as I ensured the node size, capacity, and objects to query could all be specified, and it also makes use of the standard classes built into the Unreal Engine. I noticed a large performance improvement after implementing this feature, and also added the option to visualise it, as shown in the photo here.</p>

            <p>During this project, I also had the opportunity to do code reviews with my peers. I gained experience with walking people through what I had implemented, and having them review it, as well as reviewing other peoples code to find what works well, and areas for potential improvement. It allowed me to get a deeper understanding for how to look at for parts of code that could be made more efficient, as well as where appropriate algorithms code be implemented for cleaner and more re-usable code.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I learned about unit testing, where I gained knowledge on how to test various aspects of a project, either on their own or working in conjunction with other systems, and document the result. At various stages of the projects life cycle, I reviewed the required mechanics, and analysed they're behaviour to tell Whether they were performing as they were supposed to, if there was any issues, bugs to fix, and potential areas of improvement. This was valuable as it allowed me to assess my own work, and judge what could be done better, as well as look for more efficient solutions to the ones I had originally came up with.</p>

            <p>Being a gameplay programmer, I decided to add something that allowed the player to interact with the simulation in some way. As most of the moving components were AI agents, the player wouldn't be able to control them specifically, so I added the ability to create obstacles that could be moved around the level to affect the behaviour of the boids. Being space themed, the player can add in 1 piece of debris at a time, with a maximum of 10 pieces allowed to exist in the level at any one time. The player can click on the obstacle they've made and it will follow the mouse cursor. When the player clicks again, it will release the obstacle. The player can decide to move objects in a more slow and controlled manner, or chuck them around freely. If an obstacle leaves the levels navigation radius, it will gradually move back towards the centre. The boids can detect whether they are near an obstacle and will attempt to move away from it. This small, simple mechanic was designed to allow the player some degree of interaction and control over the boids flying around the scene.</p>
