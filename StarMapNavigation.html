            <p>Star Ship Navigation was a solo university project about demonstrating an A* path finding algorithm and fundamental mathematical principles used within computer games programming. This project demonstrates procedural generation, a custom lerp library, and A* pathfinding that adjusts to a variety of constraints and variables. I used Unity and C# for this project.</p>

            <p>I implemented procedural generation to create a small galaxy, with the option for 2 different formation shapes. I have ensured that each star within does not collide with any of the others. To generate a route between the stars, I’ve implemented ‘prims algorithm’ to create a minimum spanning tree, so that it is possible for any star to be reached during pathfinding. In the application, I included the option to disable this, meaning there are pockets of stars that are disconnected from the main route, demonstrating that the A* pathfinding algorithm can detect when a route is unreachable.</p>

            <p>I implemented an A* pathfinding algorithm from scratch for this project. My approach involved using psuedo code to outline the general theory, and then convert that into the desired programming language, which in this case was C#. The algorithm can detect when a destination is impossible to reach, demonstrated in my project when the player selects a star that has no route connecting to it. I aslo created a 'pirate space' zone, where the costs of all routes existing in this space are multiplied, which shows how the algorithm can adapt and look for a route that avoids traveling through this, even if it means going a longer way around.</p>

            <p>I created a custom lerp library to move a space ship across the route selected by the player. To make the system more efficient, the types of lerps are stored as an enumeration, so it is more human-readable when choosing the desired lerp to trigger. I used an object-oriented aproach when designing the lerping function, and used polymorphism so that the same function can be called, and depending on the parameters passed in the results will vary. I also allowed the option to choose which aspect of an object is affected by the lerp, such as movement, rotation, color, and more</p>

            <p>This project allowed me to learn about some of the fundamental mathematical concepts used within games development, such as vectors, motion, physics and linear interpolation. I also discovered some more advanced topics, like procedural generation, matrices, and different pathfinding algorithms and techniques. Together, this allowed me to get a greater understanding of the different mathematical components that make up a game, and how they work together to create more advanced and interesting simulations.</p>

            <p>As my main interest lies in gameplay programming, I addded some gameplay mechanics to make my simulation more game like. I added the option to 'colonise' the star the players ship is currently located at, which gives the player the opportunity to rename the star to whatever they like (with limitations in place to prevent errors with names). This action also grants more fuel to the ship, allowing the player to continue on their journey. If the player is travelling through a star that exists in 'pirate space', there is a small chance of them being attacked by pirates, which results in a reduction of fuel. When the player runs out of fuel, they can no longer travel between stars, and the game is over.</p>
